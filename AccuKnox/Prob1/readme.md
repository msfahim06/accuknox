# Welcome

# Problem Statement: 
    A restaurant keeps a log of (eater_id, foodmenu_id) for all the diners. The eater_id is a unique number for every diner and foodmenu_id is unique for every food item served on the menu. Write a program that reads this log file and returns the top 3 menu items consumed. If you find an eater_id with the same foodmenu_id more than once then show an error.

# Solution: 
## To Flow
- main File
    * In this we are reading logfile and with the help of python we are able to return top 3 items and also can show the repeated data.

- logfiles
    * Sample lof files are created as case1 and case2

## Run
        python app/main.py
